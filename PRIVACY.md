# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

The Multi Team Delivery Forecaster template for Jira & Azure DevOps (ADO) is provided **free of charge** as an open-source resource to help teams visualize their delivery forecasts for multiple teams. 
This template is a **static configuration file** and does **not** interact with user data, Jira/ADO instances, or external systems.

## Data Collection and Usage

The Multi Team Delivery Forecaster template does **not**:
- Collect, store, or transmit any user, company, or Jira instance data.
- Require or request access to Jira API, authentication tokens, or user credentials.
- Include any code that tracks usage or connects to external services.

Since this template is purely a configuration file, there is **no personal data processing, tracking, or analytics** involved.

## Third-Party Services

This template does not rely on any third-party services, integrations, or dependencies that would result in data being shared with external entities.

## Your Responsibilities

- Users are responsible for reviewing the template before applying it to their Jira/ADO instance.
- Any modifications or extensions made by users are **outside the scope** of this privacy policy.
- If using this template in a shared or corporate Jira/ADO environment, ensure compliance with internal data policies.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

As this template does not process or collect any data, changes to this privacy policy are unlikely. However, if updates are necessary, they will be reflected in this repository.
