# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does it only cover up to 9 teams?
I built up to 9 teams as that was the max I could fit in the report page with the visuals chosen. You could copy the existing approaches if you wanted to add more teams and feel free to submit a PR if you find a way to add more!

### How many simulations does it run?
For performance reasons, it only does 500 simulations per team. As it runs per team and then overall this is ~9000 simulations in total. There may be slight differences from a model that uses 10,000 sims per team but only a few days. Here is a comparison:

### Why does it seem to be slow/sluggish?
Power BI isn't the best at performance of this type of thing. What I will say is it does cache when you have run forecasts so you can expect performance to speed up if you only make a few changes.
